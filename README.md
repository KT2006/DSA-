# **My LeetCode & DSA Journey 🚀**

Welcome to my **DSA Repository**! This repository tracks my consistent coding journey, with solutions from LeetCode and other DSA practice questions. My goal is to build a strong foundation in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** while maintaining a daily **GitHub streak**. Below is a timeline of my progress, organized from **September 19th to October 15th**.

---

## **📂 Repository Structure**
Here’s the current structure of my repository:

1. **Array Section**
   - Solutions to various **swapping techniques** (important for programming foundations).
   - Printing the **left diagonal** and **right diagonal** of matrices, including the **reversed right diagonal**.

2. **Linked List Section**
   - Solutions for **inserting nodes at any position**.
   - Implementation of **linear search** in a linked list.
   - A few files added under the **"important questions" section**.

3. **Binary Search Section**
   - Solutions for problems like:
     - **First and last occurrence** of elements.
     - Finding **total occurrences**.
     - Identifying the **odd occurring element**.

4. **Stack Section**
   - Uploaded solutions related to **stack implementation**.

5. **Queue and Sorting Sections**
   - Folders created on **October 11th**, more content coming soon!

6. **Recursion Section**
   - Posted a few **recursion-based** problems and solutions.
