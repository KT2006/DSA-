And on the same day I also added solution to print rightDiagonal of a matrix
succesfully uploaded one more solution for a problem called missing number in an array, and a also uploaded the code to print right diagonal in reverse manner
on 23/09/24 I uploaded a file in array section which has a solution to all types of swapping which are very much important when we talk about basic foundation in programming
yeah it's 29 sept and I added three more files in linked list section, basically solutions for insertion at any position and linear search in linked list 
two more files I uplaoded in imp linked list/imp questions section
#finished adding all of my files in the linked list section next I'll create few more folders and then upload all of my work in them
#uploaded two files in the binary search section instead of stack as I completely forgot about it's existence, OOPs added one more file
#added 3 more files in the binary search section all related to occurences like first, last, total and odd occuring element
